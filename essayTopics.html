					<li data-theme="b">Explain how the role of circumstance and chance play into the novel and the issue of slavery.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Stowe seems to condemn slavery in the novel without allowing any excuses for those who practice it.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She does seem to suggest that those who do practice it often times do so because of the circumstances in front of them such as where they were born and the customs to which they were raised.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She doesn't go on to excuse these people however as through the text she suggests that it is not circumstance that allows slavery, but inner evil in the slave owners that allow it.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">St. Clare seems to support this as he says the rich aristocrats who live in the slave -free north would be slave owners if born in the south.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Through this Stowe's belief that inner evil is the root of slavery, not chance is suggested.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The main argument made in the novel is that the practice of slavery can only be destroyed if the inner evil that allows it is conquered first.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">How does Stowe depict men and women in the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the novel men and women play completely different roles.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Men are depicted as gruff and morally weak characters while women are seen as righteous and morally sound.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This depiction seems to cross the color barrier as well, as the slaves and non-slaves seem to follow this description.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Their is however one exception to this, Uncle Tom.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Tom proves to be a morally sound person, who wants nothing more than a better life for his people, and is willing to do whatever is in the realm of possibility to help.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Tom proves to always be working for the common good, and never once does he appear selfish.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though this is not to suggest he is womanly, just that he is a morally sound character who knows right from wrong.</li>
