					<li data-theme="d">Arthur Shelby, a farmer from Kentucky, develops a large debt and must find a way to pay it off. In order to do so he plans to sell two of his slaves, Uncle Tom, and a young boy to a slave trader, Mr. Haley. The decision is tough on Arthur because he and his wife Emily had developed fond relationships with the slaves. Before the sale however Eliza, Emily's maid and the mother of the young slave who's being sold, over hears Emily and Arthur arguing about the sale. Out of fear for her child's well being, Eliza and her son escape after informing Uncle Tom of the sale.

Their road is difficult as a group sent out by Haley to bring them backtracks them down. The group led by a man named Loker. George manages to shoot Loker preventing them from being captured. Yet due to Eliza's good heart they take Loker to a Quaker settlement where he is saved. Loker is changed by the incident and resolves to help Eliza, George, and their son escape to Canada.
Meanwhile Uncle Tom reluctantly leaves with Haley and is placed on a boat that will take him to be sold. On the boat he befriends a young girl, Eva, who ends up falling in the river forcing Tom to jump in and save her. Tom's selfless act convinces Eva's father Augustine St. Clare to buy Tom.

However Eva grows sick and eventually dies yet leaves a profound spiritual impact on all the people around her. Augustine agrees to free Tom, as feels no prejudice towards blacks and Tom has become part of the family.
